## 📌 Project Overview
This repository is an ongoing engineering workspace dedicated to the numerical simulation of physical and financial systems. It bridges the gap between **Mechanical Vibrations (Dynamic Systems)** and **Engineering Economics (Plant Management)**.

The project is built on the philosophy of Open Science and Data-Driven Engineering. As the repository grows, it aims to evolve from pure MATLAB-based prototyping toward robust **Python-based implementations** and **statistical data analysis pipelines**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1. `/Mechanical_Systems_Vibrations` (ME 564 - Driven)
This directory contains simulations of mechanical oscillators and multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems. 
* **Focus:** State-Space modeling, solving ODEs (`ode45`), natural frequencies analysis, and nonlinear kinematics.
* **Goal:** Moving towards Python (`scipy`, `numpy`) for real-time data analysis and system identification.

### 2. `/Engineering_Economics`
A collection of tools for industrial plant assessment and financial mathematics.
* **Focus:** Investment evaluation (VAN/NPV, NFV), Cash Flow Diagram generation, and IRR (TIR) numerical solvers.
* **Goal:** Streamlining plant management workflows and financial decision-making metrics.

## 🚀 Roadmap & Future Expansion
- [ ] **Python Porting:** Migrating the core dynamics solvers (ODE integrators) from MATLAB to Python/SciPy.
- [ ] **Statistical Layer:** Integrating statistical modules to perform sensitivity analysis on simulated dynamics.
- [ ] **Data Visualization:** Moving beyond static plots into interactive visualization tools.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Adding Jupyter Notebooks for more interactive explainability of the mathematical models.

## 📌 Overview
This repository serves as a unified workspace for numerical simulations applied to **Mechanical Engineering** and **Industrial Economics**. 
The goal of this project is to model physical and economic systems mathematically, solve complex ODEs, and extract data-driven insights. 

The project is currently divided into two main domains, with plans to expand the mechanical simulations into the Python/SciPy ecosystem in the near future.

## 📂 1. Mechanical Vibrations & System Dynamics (ME 564 Style)
📍 **Folder:** `/Mechanical_Vibrations_Dynamics`

This section focuses on the numerical resolution of physical systems using State-Space representation and MATLAB ODE solvers (e.g., `ode45`).
* **Multi-DOF Systems:** State-space modeling of 2-DOF spring-mass-damper systems, including eigenvalue analysis (`eig(A)`) to compute natural frequencies.
* **Non-Linear Dynamics:** Advanced simulation of a non-linear pendulum, avoiding the small-angle approximation. Includes Live 2D Animations and computation of the exact period using the Complete Elliptic Integral of the First Kind and Taylor series expansions.
* **Forced Vibrations:** Models of damped oscillators subjected to harmonic excitation, with automated data-logging routines (.csv export) designed for future Machine Learning pipelines.

## 📂 2. Engineering Economics & Plant Management
📍 **Folder:** `/Industrial_Economics_Facilities`

A suite of tools developed to automate financial mathematics and investment appraisals for industrial plants.
* **Investment Evaluation:** Iterative solvers for Net Present Value (NPV/VAN) and Net Future Value (NFV) of industrial assets.
* **Cash Flow Automation:** Algorithms to convert continuous payments into equivalent Present/Future values, featuring automated Cash Flow Diagram plotting.
* **TIR / IRR Computation:** Custom linear interpolation algorithms optimized to find the exact Internal Rate of Return by zeroing the NPV.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- [ ] Porting the Mechanical Vibrations solvers from MATLAB to **Python** (using `numpy`, `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`).
- [ ] Applying Machine Learning (Data-Driven Discovery of Dynamics) to the exported `.csv` physical data.
- [ ] Enhancing the 2D animations using `matplotlib.animation`.
